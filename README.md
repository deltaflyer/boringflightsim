# Boring Flightsim

To honour all pilots out there who spend hours and hours everyday in their planes to get us safely from A to B, I bring you the **Boring Fligh Sim**. This flight simulator has no thrills, no effects or extraordinary features. It is just about getting you job done, press the right buttons and make smooth plane movements to make you passengers feel relaxed on board.

*Avoid fast movements, be wise in you decisions and fly smoothly...*

The simulator is not very accurate and only a pet project for programming breaks while writing my PhD thesis. It tries to simulate the 2D behavoiur of an [Airbus A 320-200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320_family#A320).

## Getting Started

To use boring flightsim, you need **Python 2.7** and **pygame**. The software was written in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. You can start like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git python-pygame
git clone https://github.com/deltaflyer/boringflightsim.git
cd boringflightsim
./run.sh
```

## Flying Advises

* Accelerate to 100 knots, in order to pull the nose of plane up and start flying
* If your speed is below 100 knots, you cannot tilt the plane anymore as air is not fast enough to produce the necessary forces
* For slowing down toggle the air break by pressing *A* The multifunction display shows the state of the airbreak.
* Try to land between 50-150 feet/minute vertical speed and 140 kts horizontal speed

## Bugs and Featues

If you find a bug, please fix it and provide a pull request. The same is fine for new features. Any contribution is welcome.
